# DiceSimulator

A pet project to make myself more familiar with Java. 
One day, this will be a useful tool for all my Pen-and-Paper-session needs. 

For now, it is a dice simulator with basic functionality:
- rolling multiple dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100) 
- DnD 5 healing potion simulator

Plans for the future: 
- Feature for DnD 5 'Wild Magic', incl. effects from external table
- Feature for WoD / Vampire Dice, incl. effects from Hunger/Red Dice
- Feature for Character Sheet Integration: from a database or csv-file entry, add boni and mali to rolls etc.
-- (probably at a much later stage)
- Installer
- Feature for Spellcasters in DnD 5
- nicer icons for all the buttons and tabs
